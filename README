# 🖥️ OCR Project - EPITA SPE Year 2 🎯  

> ⚠️ **Warning:**  
> This project is a long-term undertaking that contains numerous **errors** and is not **optimized**. It was developed as part of the **second-year curriculum** at EPITA, meaning the code may not meet professional standards and might be a bit rough around the edges.  
> Proceed with caution and be prepared to troubleshoot! 🚧


This project is an **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** system, developed as part of the **second year of the integrated preparatory program at EPITA (SPE)**. It was carried out in a **group of four**.

## 🧩 Solver  

### ▶️ Execution  
- `./solver` → executable file  
- `<path>` → path to the text file containing the grid  

⚠️ **Warning:** If your text file does not have the correct format, an **error** will occur!  

### ✅ Expected Format  
XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX

XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX

XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX

Where `X` ∈ `{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,.}`  

---

## 🎨 UI  

### ▶️ Execution  
- `./ui`

---

## 🔄 Pre-processing  

### ▶️ Execution  
- `./pret <path> <angle>`
- `<path>` → path to the image  
- `<angle>` → rotation angle (**set to `0` if no rotation is needed**)  

---

## ✂️ Cutter  

### ▶️ Execution  
- `<file_to_analyze> <file_to_cut>`

---

## 🧹 Clean  

Removes the files generated by the **cutter**.  

---

## 🏋️‍♂️ Process  

### ▶️ Execution  
- `./process <nb1> <nb2> <nb3> <nb4>`

The `process` step **trains a neural network** to output the correct value for a given input:  

- `0 -> nb1`  
- `1 -> nb2`  
- `1 -> nb3`  
- `0 -> nb4`
